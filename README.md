# ðŸ—º Astral Verifiable Spatial Data Registries

Location-based applications often require some kind of publicly-accessible geodatabase. This could be a list of points, lines, polygons, or other spatial data objects â€”Â think project areas, points of interest, virtual land parcels, road segments and so on. 

In this repository, we will develop a smart contract standard for representing spatial features, and making them available to decentralized applications. For some use cases, these contracts will import [Spatial.sol](https://github.com/AstralProtocol/spatial-sol), a Solidity library of topological and geometric functions we are also developing. This library, coupled with verifiable spatial data registries and [verifiable location claims](https://github.com/AstralProtocol/verifiable-location-credentials), will enable on-chain geospatial computation and open up a new category of applications on the decentralized web.

Exact project outputs are being developed. Read more about our thinking behind verifiable spatial data registries in our [docs](https://docs.astral.global/spatial-data-registry). If you'd like to contribute, reach out to us on Twitter [@astralprotocol](https://twitter.com/astralprotocol).
